A full Stack Developer is a professional that has the ability to work on both front-end and back-end properties of a web application.
They help the user interact with the web application smoothly. In the front-end development part, they help design and develop user 
interfaces using crucial languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These developers work with frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular 
in the production environment. In the back-end development, they help with server-side logic and APIs, with the help of languages 
like Node.js, Python, Java, and PHP. Frameworks like Express.js, Django, or Spring Boot are used to help with the production environment. 
A full Stack developer also aids in managing data storage using databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB. 

The prominent role of a full stack developer is to design API’s like RESTful and GraphQL. This enhances communication between front-end 
and back-end. These developers also need to be good at version control systems like Git to keep track of any changes and to be able to 
collaborate well with other developers. A full stack-developer starts with learning the basics of web-development and after that they go 
on to mastering front-end and back-end languages. All in all, a full stack developer is a problem solver who needs to understand the full 
lifecyle of a web application.
